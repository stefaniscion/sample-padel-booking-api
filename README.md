# Sample Padel Booking API
I made this API for an interview where i was asked to create a small project of a Padel Booking Api.

## Technologies
I used the following technologies:
- Python - https://www.python.org/
- FastAPI - https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/
- SQLAlchemy - https://www.sqlalchemy.org/
- PostgreSQL - https://www.postgresql.org/

## How to run
I used mamba to run the application, so i do:
```bash
mamba install --file requirements.txt
```
to install the dependencies and then i run the application with:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
